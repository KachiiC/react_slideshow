        description: "Sprawl-and-Brawl is a stand-up fighting tactic that consists of effective stand-up striking, while avoiding ground fighting, typically by using sprawls to defend against takedowns. A Sprawl-and-Brawler is usually a boxer or kickboxer, Thai boxer or karate fighter who has trained in various styles of wrestling, judo, and/or sambo to avoid takedowns to keep the fight standing. This is a form which is heavily practiced in the amateur leagues. These fighters will often study submission wrestling to avoid being forced into submission should they find themselves on the ground. This style can be deceptively different from traditional kickboxing styles, since sprawl-and-brawlers must adapt their techniques to incorporate takedown and ground fighting defence.",

        description: "Clinch-Fighting is a tactic consisting of using a clinch hold to prevent the opponent from moving away into more distant striking range, while also attempting takedowns and striking the opponent using knees, stomps, elbows, and punches. The clinch is often utilized by wrestlers and Judokas that have added components of the striking game (typically boxing), and Muay Thai fighters. Wrestlers and Judoka may use clinch fighting as a way to neutralise the superior striking skills of a stand-up fighter or to prevent takedowns by a superior ground fighter. In modern mma, clinch fighting often takes place against the cage/ropes by wrestlers. Although many fans view this strategy as the most boring style of fighting and is highly criticized but it's very effective against high level strikers.",

        description: "Ground-and-pound is a strategy consisting of taking an opponent to the ground, obtaining a top, or dominant grappling position, and then striking the opponent. Strikes primarily consist of punches, hammerfists, and elbows with the aim of knocking out your oponnent or making them submit. Ground-and-pound is also used as a precursor to attempting submission holds. The style is used by fighters well-versed in submission defence and skilled at takedowns. Although not a traditional style of striking, the effectiveness and reliability of ground-and-pound has made it a popular tactic in mma. This style is particular effective in neutralising the effectiveness of high level strikers and tiring out the opposition. Top control is also viewed more favourably in the eyes of the judges.",

        description: "Submission-Seeking is a reference to the strategy of taking an opponent to the ground using a takedown or throw and then applying a submission hold, forcing the opponent to submit. While grapplers will often work to attain dominant position, some may be more comfortable fighting from other positions. If a grappler finds themselves unable to force a takedown, they may resort to pulling guard, whereby they physically pull their opponent into a dominant position on the ground. Submissions are an essential part of many disciplines, most notably Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, catch wrestling, judo, Sambo, and shootwrestling. Submission-based styles were popularized in the early UFC events by Royce Gracie when he submitted much larger opposition.",
